*   **SML 7.CO 1.C 4.Q 1:** Is there a formal concept or policy for role-based or attribute-based access controls that ensures users have access only according to their defined roles and responsibilities?

#### SML 7.CO 1.C 5 (Technical)
*   **Scope:** Client Facing Service 
*   **Service Type:** Managed Service, AI Service, SaaS
*   Segregation of access between customer and provider is enforced, preventing unauthorized or undisclosed privileged access by the provider.
*   **SML 7.CO 1.C 5.Q 1:** How is access between customer and provider controlled to prevent unrestricted or undisclosed privileged access by the provider?

#### SML 7.CO 1.C 6 (Technical)
*   **Scope:** Underlying Service 
*   **Service Type:** PaaS, IaaS
*   Identity and access control mechanisms, including identity federation and integration with external identity providers, are supported and enforced for all users.
*   **SML 7.CO 1.C 6.Q 1:** How are identity and access control mechanisms implemented in the underlying services, including identity federation and integration with external identity providers?
